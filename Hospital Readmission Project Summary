Hospital Readmission Project Summary

The objective of this project was to understand hospital readmisison rates and factors which may be key drivers in influencing these rates. Furthermore, the objective was to critique a preliminary analysis which had been performed. 

I began by performing statistical tests to confirm or disprove the conclusions presented in the preliminary analyses. I found that yes indeed, there was a significant negative correlation between discharge rates and excess readmissions ratio, and that there was a small but significant increase in excess readmission ratios in hospitals with low discharge numbers compared to hospitals with high discharge numbers. 

I continued by investigating the relationship between number of discharge and excess readmission ratio and found that there wasn't a perfect linear relationship between number of discharges and excess readmission ratio. This suggests that there is another underlying factor which may also be influencing excess readmission ratio.

I segmented the data by different variables and found that those with low excess readmission ratios also had fewer Hip-Knee and AMI (Acute Myocardial Infarction) measurements. 

I then tested to see whether or not Hip-Knee/AMI measurements were also contributing to excess readmission ratios and found that the highest excess readmissions ratios existed in Hip-Knee/AMI measurements of facilities with low discharge rates (<100)

This allows for a more precise reccommedation to be made such that small facilities with high incidence of Hip-Knee or AMI procedures should be provided more support
